/**
* In this example, we make a simple search query with a special sort order and get the first search results according to this order
*
* NB: MAKE SURE NEVER TO RE-RANK THE RESULTS AFFTER GETTING THEM FROM BOXALINO SEARCH: BECAUSE YOU ONLY RECEIVE THE FIRST PAGE
* TO ORDER THE SEARCH RESULT, YOU MUST PROVIDE THE SORT FIELDS INFORMATION AND REQUEST THE RESULTS DIRECTLY SORTED AND DISPLAY THEM AS RETURNED
*
* NB: DO NOT SORT THE RESULTS UNLESS THE USER HAS REQUESTED A SPECIAL SORTING OPTION, BECAUSE ALL BOXALION RANKING OPTIMIZATION WILL ONLY WORK IF THERE ARE NO SORT FIELDS DEFINED
