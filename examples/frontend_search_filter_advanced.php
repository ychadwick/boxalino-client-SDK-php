* In this example, we make a simple search query, add a more advanced filters with 2 fields with values and an or conditions between them and get the search results and print their ids
* Filters are different than facets because they are not returned to the user and should not be related to a user interaction
* Filters should be "system" filters (e.g.: filter on a category within a category page, filter on product which are visible and not out of stock, etc.)
